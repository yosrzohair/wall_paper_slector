Steps to Solve the Task

1. Understanding the Requirements

The program takes two command-line arguments: latitude and longitude.

It determines the current time in UTC.

It calculates the sunrise and sunset times for the given location.

It selects an appropriate wallpaper based on whether the sun is above or below the horizon.

It prints the selected image file name as output.

2. Getting the Current Time

The program retrieves the current system time in UTC to ensure accuracy.

3. Calculating Sunrise and Sunset

To determine whether it is day or night, the program calculates sunrise and sunset times based on the given latitude and longitude.

It uses mathematical formulas or an API to compute these times.

4. Selecting the Wallpaper

If the current time is before sunrise or after sunset, the program selects night.png.

Otherwise, it determines the appropriate time of day (e.g., morning, noon, evening) and selects the corresponding image.

5. Implementation Details

The program is written in Python.

It does not use external libraries except for standard ones allowed in the task.

The image set is stored in an images/ directory.

The output is printed in stdout as required by the task.

6. Execution Example

yosr@LENOVOS142M2N:/mnt/c/wallpaper_selector$ python3 wallpaper_selector.py 31.9544 35.9106
night.png

This indicates that the sun is below the horizon at the provided coordinates, so night.png is selected.

7. Testing and Verification

The program was tested with different locations and times.

The results were cross-checked with online sunrise/sunset calculators.

The logic was verified to ensure correctness.

Conclusion

This solution successfully meets the requirements by selecting the correct wallpaper based on the sun's position at a given location. The approach is efficient, accurate, and adheres to the task constraints.
